# Public-Pitch-Quality-Models
Public Pitching+ and Stuff+ Models <br>

These public pitch models serve to provide anyone interested with:<br>
- A template to create your own Stuff+ / Pitching + models via XGBoost.
- Pitch-by-pitch expected run values, which as far as I'm aware are not available publicly (public pitch modeling numbers are availble on FanGraphs and other areas, but only aggregated by pitcher / pitch type).

I'm hoping to improve the code and models are displayed overtime with help from the community. I'd love to hear feedback, comments, critiques etc. and any sort of analysis or findings in the data. I can be found on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/chasecopp5).
