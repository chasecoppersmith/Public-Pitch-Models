# Public-Pitch-Quality-Models
Public Pitching+ and Stuff+ Models

These public pitch models serve to provide anyone interested with:
-A template to create your own Stuff+ / Pitching + models via XGBoost.
-Pitch-by-pitch expected run values, which as far as I'm aware are not available publicly (public pitch modeling numbers are availble on FanGraphs and other areas, but only aggregated by pitcher / pitch type).
